* Outline and Goals
** Fundamental Questions
   + What are the limits of computers? \pause
   + Are there problems a computer can never solve? \pause
   + Do all programming languages describe the same thing? \pause
   + What even *are* programs? 
** How We'll Answer Them
   + Give intuitive criterion for "computability" as finite process \pause
   + Build up a definition of computation independent of computers \pause
   + Sketch out mathematical models of computation \pause
   + Give examples of non-computable problems \pause
   + Discuss the implications and limits of our knowledge of computability
* Computers and Programs
** Computation Sounds Like Computer
   + Computation is what computers do \pause
   + A program /describes/ a computation \pause
   + The limits of computation are limits of *description* \pause 
   + What processes can be *described* in a finite way with a finite *implementation*?
** Examples of Finite Processes

Cook celery and onion together til soft, then add frozen spinach and cook to get some of the moisture out and reduce volume add broth lentils cilantro and other spices, stir thoroughly, throw bay leaves on top.

Cook for 40 minutes

Turn off heat, wait til it stops bubbling and blend thoroughly.

Cook for 5-10 minutes after blending

    :END:
   No computer and no *physical process* that we know of can use an infinite quantity, thus infinite resources shouldn't be allowed in computation.
** Finite Descriptions
*** 								    :B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block

 Finite processes are only allowed to have a finite number of steps in their description, i.e. a finite length as a string \pause

*** Why Finite Directions?				      :B_block:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :END:
    Any process that has an infinite number of steps in its description would: \pause
    + take necessarily infinite time to process and run \pause
      + not *absolutely* a bad thing, but likely so \pause
    + take infinite *resources* to store \pause
      + this is *absolutely* bad
