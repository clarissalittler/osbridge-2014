* Introduction
meta-note: let's try and make sure that we have about a slide for every 30 seconds, which means roughly 90 slides. Although, truly, if we want to leave time for a few questions at the end maybe I should make it something like 35 minutes or 40 minutes instead. Also, doing it ignite style even for 40 minutes should be about 160 slides. Which might be doable by probably difficult as hell. That would involve writing like 50 slides a week.
