** What Are Computers, Really?	
   + Physical devices that carry out computation
     #+BEAMER: \pause
   + We're done!
** What Are Computers, Really?
   + Thanks you've been a wonderful audience!
     \pause
   + Wait, no, sorry let's back up
     \pause
   + Computers are things that compute
   + We haven't the foggiest what computation means
** What +Are+ Is +Computers+ Computation, Really?
   + The right question!
   + Computations are a subset of mathematical operations
   + All computations are definable in mathematics
   + Not all +men+ mathematics!
* Computation
** Computation: An Informal Definition?
   A mathematical operation is computable when it takes:
   + Finite rules
   + Finite steps
   + Finite data
   What does this really mean, though?
** A subtle slight of hand
   + Can't we write infinite loops?
   + Operating Systems
   + Web Servers
   + Stuck vs. Waiting for Input
** Examples of Computation
   + Counting on your fingers
     \pause
   + Alphabetizing books
     \pause
   + Evaluating 3*10-7 by hand
     \pause
   + Listing all the files in a directory
** More Examples of Computation
   + Is $\text{gcd}(a,b)$, for all $a,b$ computable?
     \pause
   + Yes! You can follow Euclid's algorithm for any two numbers
     \pause
   + Is $\int^a_b\int^c_d f(x,y) dx dy$, for all $f,a,b,c,d$, computable?
     \pause
   + No! For most functions this is only approxmitely computable
     + Numerical integration
     + Monte Carlo methods
     + Runge-Kutta for 1-d case
** Compare and Contrast
   + An algorithm captures notion of computation
   (Insert Euclid's algorithm description)
      + Finite steps
      + Finite data
      + Finite rules
** Compare and Contrast
    + Compare with $\int^a_b f(x) dx$
   (Insert description of infinite sum)
      + +Finite steps+
      + Finite data (?)
      + Finite rules
** Algorithms
    + "step-by-step procedure for calculation"
    + Intuitive understanding matches informal definition of computation
    + For every functions, does there exist an algorithm that computes it?
    + Just because Riemmanian integral doesn't work...
    + Abscence of evidence blah blah blah
** The limits of algorithms
   + Not all mathematical functions have a computable implementation
   + Some functions are /inherently/ incomputable
   + Easy to prove with counting and sets
* Sets 
** Sets in mathematics
   + Sets are collections of objects
   + An object is just A Thing
   + Sets have a "size" called cardinality
     (insert image of basket of cats)
   + What size is this?
   + Finite sets are sets whose size is a natural number $(0,1,\ldots)$
** Infinite sets
   + The set of all natural numbers
     \pause
   + The set of all real numbers
     \pause
   + The set of possible sentences in english
     \pause
   + The set of speakers you'd rather be listening to
** How infinite is infinite
   + Infinity comes in different sizes!
   \pause
   + Which is bigger: the integers or the natural numbers?
   \pause
   + They're the same!
   \pause
   + Which is bigger: the natural numbers or the set of sentences in English?
   \pause
   + They're the same!
   \pause
   + Which is bigger: the set of sentences or the set of programs in Ruby?
   \pause
   + They're the same!
   \pause
   + Which is bigger: the set of programs in Ruby or the set of functions from integers to integers?
   \pause
   + The set of functions from integers to integers!
** Sets of functions
   + How many functions 
* Turing Machines
* Lambda Calculus
* Constructive Mathematics
